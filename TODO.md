# Keyboard Input Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) setup:**
   - Ensure the IDT is properly set up to handle the keyboard interrupt (IRQ 1, which is typically mapped to interrupt 33 or 0x21).
   - Verify that the `idt_init()` function in `structures.rs` correctly sets up this entry.

2. **Implement a more robust keyboard interrupt handler:**
   - Modify the `keyboard_interrupt_handler()` function in `mod.rs` (interrupts module) to properly handle keyboard input.
   - This handler should read the scancode from the keyboard controller (port 0x60).

3. **Create a scancode-to-character mapping:**
   - Implement a function to convert scancodes to ASCII characters or key events.
   - Handle both make (key press) and break (key release) codes.

4. **Implement a keyboard buffer:**
   - Create a circular buffer to store keyboard input.
   - This buffer will allow the kernel to handle multiple keystrokes between processing cycles.

5. **Update the PIC configuration:**
   - Ensure that the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is configured to allow keyboard interrupts.
   - This is partially done in the `remap_pic()` function, but verify that IRQ 1 is unmasked.

6. **Implement a keyboard driver:**
   - Create a new module (e.g., `keyboard.rs`) to encapsulate keyboard-related functionality.
   - This module should include functions to initialize the keyboard, read from the keyboard buffer, and handle special keys (e.g., modifiers like Shift, Ctrl, Alt).

7. **Update the kernel main loop:**
   - Modify the `rust_main` function in `lib.rs` to periodically check for keyboard input.
   - Process any available input from the keyboard buffer.

8. **Implement basic input echoing:**
   - As a test, implement functionality to echo keyboard input to the screen using the existing VGA driver.

9. **Handle special keys and combinations:**
   - Implement handling for special keys like arrow keys, function keys, etc.
   - Handle key combinations (e.g., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Alt+Del) as needed.

10. **Error handling and edge cases:**
    - Implement proper error handling for keyboard-related issues (e.g., buffer overflow, invalid scancodes).
    - Handle edge cases like key repeats and multiple keys pressed simultaneously.

11. **Testing and debugging:**
    - Develop a set of test cases to verify keyboard input functionality.
    - Implement debugging output to help troubleshoot any issues that arise during development.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Document the keyboard input system, including its architecture, key functions, and usage instructions.
    - Update any existing documentation to reflect the new keyboard input capabilities.
