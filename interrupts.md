# Implementing Interrupts in an i386 Kernel

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to implementing interrupts in your i386 kernel. Each step includes a testing point to ensure everything is working correctly before proceeding.

## 1. Implement the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

- Create a new file: `idt.rs`
- Define the IDT entry structure
- Create an array of 256 IDT entries
- Implement a function to load the IDT

**Test**: Print a message after loading the IDT to ensure it doesn't crash.

## 2. Set up the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)

- Create a new file: `pic.rs`
- Implement functions to initialize and configure the 8259 PIC
- Remap the PIC to use interrupts 32-47 instead of 0-15

**Test**: Verify that the PIC is correctly remapped by checking its configuration registers.

## 3. Implement basic interrupt handlers

- Create handler functions for common interrupts (e.g., timer, keyboard)
- Register these handlers in your IDT

**Test**: Add a breakpoint or print statement in each handler to verify they're being called.

## 4. Implement the interrupt service routine (ISR) stubs

- Create assembly stubs for each interrupt that saves the CPU state and calls the Rust handler
- Implement an interrupt dispatcher in Rust that calls the appropriate handler based on the interrupt number

**Test**: Trigger a software interrupt (e.g., `int 3` for breakpoint) and verify that the correct handler is called.

## 5. Enable interrupts

- Implement a function to enable interrupts (sti instruction)
- Call this function after setting up the IDT and PIC

**Test**: Verify that the CPU's interrupt flag is set.

## 6. Set up the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)

- Create a new file: `pit.rs`
- Implement functions to initialize and configure the PIT
- Set up a regular timer interrupt (e.g., 100 Hz)

**Test**: Verify that the timer interrupt is being called at the expected frequency.

## 7. Implement keyboard handling

- Set up the keyboard interrupt handler
- Implement basic scancode to ASCII conversion

**Test**: Type on the keyboard and verify that characters are being received and processed correctly.

## 8. Implement exception handling

- Create handlers for CPU exceptions (e.g., page fault, general protection fault)
- Register these handlers in your IDT

**Test**: Intentionally trigger exceptions (e.g., divide by zero) and verify that they're caught and handled properly.

## 9. Implement an interrupt-safe print function

- Modify your existing print function to be interrupt-safe (e.g., using a spinlock)

**Test**: Verify that printing from within an interrupt handler doesn't cause issues.

## 10. Set up a basic task switching mechanism

- Implement a simple round-robin scheduler
- Use the timer interrupt to trigger task switches

**Test**: Create a few simple tasks and verify that they're being switched correctly.

## General Testing Strategies

- Use QEMU's debug features (e.g., `-d int`) to log interrupts
- Implement a debug log that writes to a separate serial port for non-intrusive debugging
- Use breakpoints and step through your code using a debugger like GDB
- Implement assertions to catch unexpected states early

Remember to handle edge cases and error conditions at each step. Interrupt handling is a critical part of the kernel, and robust error handling is essential for system stability.
